/*
  The aim of this topic is:
    Build a std::vector<unsigned> containing the N first gray codes

  Your implementation has to be put in a file called implem.cpp or implem_*.cpp and include aim.hpp
  or in a file called implem.hpp or implem_*.hpp which would be included as header file
  where * can be anything you want
*/

// Algorithm to be tested

std::vector<unsigned> build_grays(unsigned N);
