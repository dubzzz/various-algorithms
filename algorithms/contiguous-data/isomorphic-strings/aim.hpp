  The aim of this topic is:
    http://www.programcreek.com/2014/05/leetcode-isomorphic-strings-java/
    Given two strings s and t, determine if they are isomorphic. Two strings are isomorphic if the characters in s can be replaced to get t.
    For example,"egg" and "add" are isomorphic, "foo" and "bar" are not.
