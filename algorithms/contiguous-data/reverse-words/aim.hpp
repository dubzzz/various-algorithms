/*
  The aim of this topic is:
    Reverse words in a sentence
    Inspired from: http://www.programcreek.com/2014/05/leetcode-reverse-words-in-a-string-ii-java/
    
    Hypothesis:
      - inputs contain only characters a-z, A-Z and space
      - there is always a word between two spaces
      - string never starts or ends by a space
    Example: "the sky is blue" becomes "blue is sky the"

// Algorithm to be tested
